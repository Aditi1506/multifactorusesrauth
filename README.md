# The Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) System for User
The project aims to create a user authentication portal with signup/register and login/logout functionality. In today's digitalized society, authentication plays a crucial role in maintaining secure processes. This project explores the evolution of authentication systems, from Single-Factor Authentication (SFA) to Two-factor Authentication (2FA), and focuses on the implementation of Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) for human-to-everything interactions.
